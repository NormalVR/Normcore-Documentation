# RealtimeAvatarVoice

RealtimeAvatarVoice is a component that creates a voice stream in Normcore. If the RealtimeView that this component is attached to is owned by the local client, it will create the audio stream and connect it to the local microphone. If itâ€™s owned by a remote client, it will automatically create an AudioSource to play the audio stream through.
