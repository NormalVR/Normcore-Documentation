class_members:
- name: Static Fields
  members:
  - name: ExecutionOrder
    definition: public int ExecutionOrder
- name: Events
  members:
  - name: ownerIDSelfDidChange
    definition: event Action<RealtimeView, int> ownerIDSelfDidChange
    summary: Dispatched when the ownerIDSelf value changes.
  - name: didReplaceAllComponentModels
    definition: event Action<RealtimeView> didReplaceAllComponentModels
    summary: Dispatched after all of the components of this view have been initialized with a new Realtime model.
- name: Fields
  members:
  - name: sceneViewWillRegisterWithRealtime
    definition: public SceneViewWillRegisterDelegate sceneViewWillRegisterWithRealtime
    summary: Called when a scene view is about to register with Realtime. Use this to return a different Realtime instance than whatever was assigned in the scene, like on scene views that were additively loaded. This should be set during Awake, and is called during Start.
- name: Properties
  members:
  - name: viewUUID
    definition: string viewUUID { get; }
    summary: The UUID of a RealtimeView instance. This is used to associate scene objects across clients and sessions. For scene objects, it is pregenerated by the editor. For prefab objects, it is null. Any changes to it will break persistence.
  - name: isChildView
    definition: bool isChildView { get; }
    summary: True if the view is a child view.
  - name: isRootView
    definition: bool isRootView { get; }
    summary: True if the view is a root view (scene or prefab).
  - name: isPrefabView
    definition: bool isPrefabView { get; }
    summary: True if the view is part of a prefab view hierarchy.
  - name: isSceneView
    definition: bool isSceneView { get; }
    summary: True if the view is part of a scene view hierarchy.
  - name: isRootSceneView
    definition: bool isRootSceneView { get; }
    summary: True if the view is a root scene view.
  - name: isRootPrefabView
    definition: bool isRootPrefabView { get; }
    summary: True if the view is a root prefab view.
  - name: realtimeView
    definition: RealtimeView realtimeView { get; }
    summary: The RealtimeView that owns this component. Accessing this property before Start is unreliable.
  - name: realtime
    definition: Realtime realtime { get; }
    summary: The Realtime instance that is managing this component. On prefab views, this property is available after Awake. On scene views or their children, this is not available until Start.
  - name: room
    definition: Room room { get; }
    summary: The current room of the Realtime instance that is managing this component. This might be null if the Realtime instance hasn't connected yet. Accessing this property before Start is unreliable.
  - name: ownerIDSelf
    definition: int ownerIDSelf { get; }
    summary: The client ID of the component owner.
  - name: ownerIDInHierarchy
    definition: int ownerIDInHierarchy { get; }
    summary: The client ID of the component's hierarchy owner (the root owner of the component).
  - name: isUnownedSelf
    definition: bool isUnownedSelf { get; }
    summary: True if the component is not owned by any client.
  - name: isUnownedInHierarchy
    definition: bool isUnownedInHierarchy { get; }
    summary: True if the component and all of its parent views are not owned by any client.
  - name: isOwnedLocallySelf
    definition: bool isOwnedLocallySelf { get; }
    summary: True if the component is owned by the local client.
  - name: isOwnedLocallyInHierarchy
    definition: bool isOwnedLocallyInHierarchy { get; }
    summary: True if the component and all of its parent views are owned by the local client.
  - name: isOwnedRemotelySelf
    definition: bool isOwnedRemotelySelf { get; }
    summary: True if the component is owned by a remote client.
  - name: isOwnedRemotelyInHierarchy
    definition: bool isOwnedRemotelyInHierarchy { get; }
    summary: True if this component and all of its parent views are owned by a remote client.
  - name: preventOwnershipTakeover
    definition: bool preventOwnershipTakeover { get; set; }
    summary: If true, the model owner must clear ownership before another client can request it.
  - name: destroyWhenLastClientLeaves
    definition: bool destroyWhenLastClientLeaves { get; set; }
    summary: If true, the model is destroyed when the last client in the room leaves.
  - name: destroyWhenOwnerLeaves
    definition: bool destroyWhenOwnerLeaves { get; set; }
    summary: If true, the model is destroyed when the owner of the model leaves the room.
- name: Methods
  members:
  - name: GetRootView
    definition: RealtimeView GetRootView()
    summary: Returns the root view of this view, or this view if it is the root.
  - name: GetParentView
    definition: RealtimeView GetParentView()
    summary: Returns the parent view of this view, or null if this is the root view.
  - name: OnBeforeSerialize
    definition: void OnBeforeSerialize()
  - name: OnAfterDeserialize
    definition: void OnAfterDeserialize()

  - name: SetOwnership
    definition: void SetOwnership(int clientID)
    summary: Set ownership of the component.
