title: RealtimeSet<TValue>
layout: Reference
category: API Reference
class_name: RealtimeSet<TValue>
class_summary: RealtimeSet is a special model type that represents an unordered collection of models. Internally this is used for things like keeping track of all RealtimeViews in the scene. If order is not important, this collection is the recommended collection to use for storing collections of models. All updates are applied instantly and are rolled back if rejected by the server (due to ownership). Adding or removing items sends the minimal amount of information to the server in order to perform the update on all clients. The whole collection is not sent every time.
