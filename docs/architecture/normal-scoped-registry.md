# Normal Scoped Registry
The Normcore plugin automatically adds a [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html) to the project:

![](./normal-scoped-registry/scoped-registry.png "The Normal scoped registry information in the project settings window.")

This registry provides the Normcore package (installed automatically) as well as optional packages that we develop at Normal.

These packages can be accessed in the ["My Registries" section](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-install.html) of the Unity Package Manager.
