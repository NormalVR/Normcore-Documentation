# What is Normcore?

[Normcore](https://normcore.io/) is a networking plugin and hosting service created by [Normal](https://normalvr.com/). 

Built on a client / server model. Normcore keeps the state of all clients in a room synchronized so that they feel like they're apart of the same space. Normcore is a perfect fit for everything from mobile games, MMORPGs, XR applications, and productivity tools. Whether you're supporting 1v1 games, or 100+ battle-royal matches, Normcore has you covered.

Normcore includes a hosting service that scales automatically as you do. However, you can also host it yourself if you choose to. Normcore Private comes in single-room and cloud varieties that include all of the auto-scaling technology that's used to host our servers. There's even an option to have Normal's DevOps team run your On-Premises servers for you.

Whatever you need to build, we've got you covered.


## Why should I use Normcore?

Writing your own multiplayer networking /sucks/. It takes forever, and it’s a real pain to test.
Hosting your own servers /sucks/. You’ll want to host in at least 10 regions if you plan to launch globally. Ensuring your servers are up and running 24/7 requires a dedicated team.
Scaling your servers /sucks/. Success is a great problem to have, but losing it because your servers don’t scale automatically is a great way to throw out all of your hard work. Normcore is a hosted solution that scales automatically, and with Normcore Private, you can host it yourself and even have Normal’s DevOps team manage your servers.

Because time is money, and Normcore will save you /years/ of development time. Real-time networking isn’t easy, but for most cases, it /is/ a solved problem. Whether you’re trying to implement smooth transform syncing, efficient serialization, congestion control, support for networks that block UDP, or scaling servers to millions of users, someone before you has solved these problems. However, discovering and implementing thousands of these techniques is not an easy task.

If you want to ship a product that works well, works everywhere, and is easy to develop, Normcore is the right choice. Our team of AAA networking engineers spend countless hours testing and implementing the best multiplayer networking techniques in one single package.

Oh, and we've done it correctly: [Why Normcore?](https://normcore.io/why-normcore)
