- name: Events
  members:
  - name: onWillWrite
    definition: event TransformWriteHandler onWillWrite
  - name: onDidRead
    definition: event TransformReadHandler onDidRead
- name: Properties
  members:
  - name: useGravity
    definition: bool useGravity { get; set; }
    summary: True if the rigidbody on this transform is using gravity on the simulating client.
  - name: isKinematic
    definition: bool isKinematic { get; set; }
    summary: True if the rigidbody on this transform is kinematic on the simulating client.
  - name: isSleeping
    definition: bool isSleeping { get; set; }
    summary: True if the rigidbody on this transform is sleeping on the simulating client.
  - name: maintainOwnershipWhileSleeping
    definition: bool maintainOwnershipWhileSleeping { get; set; }
    summary: True if the rigidbody on this transform shouldn't clear ownership when it sleeps. This is useful for rigidbodies that should never be simulated on different clients, like player objects.
  - name: timestamp
    definition: double timestamp { get; }
  - name: hasTransformChanges
    definition: bool hasTransformChanges { get; }
    summary: True if the model has any pending transform changes it needs to send to the datastore.
  - name: hasPhysicsBodyChanges
    definition: bool hasPhysicsBodyChanges { get; }
    summary: True if the model has any pending physics body changes it needs to send to the datastore.
  - name: hasPhysicsStateChanges
    definition: bool hasPhysicsStateChanges { get; }
    summary: True if the model has any pending physics state changes it needs to send to the datastore.
