category: API Reference
class_name: StringKeyDictionary<TValue>
class_summary: StringKeyDictionary represents a dictionary collection of models. Unlike RealtimeDictionary, StringKeyDictionary is transactional. This means that models are not added to the collection until they are confirmed by the server. If any key has been modified before your change reaches the server, it will be rejected. It is up to your application to decide whether to retry the operation. Adding or removing items sends the minimal amount of information to the server in order to perform the update on all clients. The whole collection is not sent every time. Once a key has been added, it is assigned a unique ID by the server to reduce bandwidth for future updates.

    - name: key
      description: The key to use to store the model.
    - name: value
      description: The model to store in the collection. This value cannot be null.
    - name: completionHandler
      description: A completion handler that fires when the operation is complete along with a boolean to indicate if the transaction was successful.
  - name: Remove
    definition: void Remove(string key, Action<bool> completionHandler)

    parameters:
    - name: key
      description: The key of the model to remove.
    - name: completionHandler
      description: A completion handler that fires when the operation is complete along with a boolean to indicate if the transaction was successful.
  - name: Clear
    definition: void Clear(Action<bool> completionHandler)
    summary: Clear all models from the collection. Models will not be removed until the server confirms the transaction.
    remarks: This operation will be rejected if any keys have been modified before the clear operation reaches the server.
    parameters:
    - name: completionHandler
      description: A completion handler that fires when the operation is complete along with a boolean to indicate if the transaction was successful.
  - name: TryGetValue
    definition: bool TryGetValue(string key, TValue& value)
    summary: Attempt to retrieve a value from the collection.
    remarks: This method will not throw an exception if the key is not found.
