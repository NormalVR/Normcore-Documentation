    definition: public SceneViewWillRegisterDelegate sceneViewWillRegisterWithRealtime
    summary: Called when a scene view is about to register with Realtime. Use this to return a different Realtime instance than whatever was assigned in the scene, like on scene views that were additively loaded. This should be set during Awake, and is called during Start.
- name: Properties
  members:
  - name: viewUUID
    definition: string viewUUID { get; }
    summary: The UUID of a RealtimeView instance. This is used to associate scene objects across clients and sessions. For scene objects, it is pregenerated by the editor. For prefab objects, it is null. Any changes to it will break persistence.

    definition: bool preventOwnershipTakeover { get; set; }
    summary: If true, the model owner must clear ownership before another client can request it.

    definition: bool destroyWhenLastClientLeaves { get; set; }
    summary: If true, the model is destroyed when the last client in the room leaves.
