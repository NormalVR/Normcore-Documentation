# Pricing
Normcore provides auto-scaling servers that can host any project. We also provide the lowest latency  possible in any every region around the globe.

### Our pricing model
We offer [three pricing tiers](https://normcore.io/pricing) to meet your needs.

// TODO: Insert Graphic

We charge based solely on room hours and bandwidth:

**Room hours.** Room hours refer to the total number of hours that a room server is running and clients are connected. If no one is actively connected to a room, you are not being charged.

**Bandwidth.** Bandwidth refers to the amount of data sent to and from Normcore's servers.

### Fixed option versus unlimited option
**Fixed.** Our prototype and Pro plans include fixed allotments of room hours and bandwidth. When you hit these limits, Normcore Pauses your apoplications to precent you from incurring any additional charges.

**Unlimited.** Our Unlimited plan includes the same allotment of room hours and bandwidth as the Pro plan. However, it also allows you to go beyond those limits. We bill for any excess hours and bandwidth at a fixed rate. Usage numbers reset at the beginning of each month.

### Tracking Usage
Your Normcore dashboard is updated to show your most recent room-hour and bandwidth measurements every 24 hours at 12 AM, GMT.

### Changing plans
We welcome you to change plans at any time in your billing cycle so Normcore can best meet your needs. Changes in room-hour and bandwidth limits take place immediately. For instance, you will be able to exceed the fixed limits right away if you switch from Pro to Unlimited, even in the middle of a billing cycle.
