# Pricing
Normcore provides servers to host your games that scale automatically, and provide the lowest latency experience possible in any region around the globe. Our pricing information is always available at https://normcore.io/pricing.

//TODO: Can we embed the plans here easily?

## How do you charge for Normcore?
Pay only for what you need. Normcore bills you for two things:
Room hours
Bandwidth

Room hours are the total hours that a room server is running and clients are connected. If no one is actively connected to a room, you’re not being charged.

Bandwidth is the amount of network traffic sent to and from Normcore’s servers.


## How do the plans work?
Worried about getting a surprise bill at the end of the month? That’s why we created plans.

Each plan includes a fixed amount of room hours and bandwidth. With our Prototype and Pro plans, when you hit the limit, Normcore will pause your applications to prevent you from incurring any usage charges.

With the Unlimited plan, you still get the same included room hours and bandwidth as the Pro plan, however, once you hit the limit, we’ll start billing you at a fixed rate for only the room hours and bandwidth that you use each month.

## Can I change my plan at any time?
You sure can! You can always change your plan at any time in your billing cycle. If you switch from Pro to Unlimited, the changes take effect immediately.
