# Normcore Documentation

Welcome to our documentation repo! These are the docs files that are used to generate the pages on https://docs.normcore.io/.

All of us at Normal do our best to write thorough documentation, but occasionally there are features we may have missed or areas of the API that could use extra clarification.

Want to contribute an update? Open up a [Pull Request](https://github.com/NormalVR/Normcore-Documentation/compare) with what you would like to add! It may take us a few days to review, but we'll get it integrated into the official docs.

Outside perspectives are always welcome! We'd love to know areas in our API that are difficult to understand, and how we can improve our documentation accordingly.
